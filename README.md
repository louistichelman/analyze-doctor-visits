# analyze-doctor-visits
In this small university project the time process of doctor visits was analyzed. We therefor were looking at synthetic data about patients of some imaginary doctorÂ´s office:
- patients.csv contains information like weight and gender about all the patients.
- visits.csv stores information about each visit of a patient (particularly the time).

We were particularly interested in predicting the time period until a patient would return, i.e. estimating the hazard rate of the event of the next visit of a patient.
